# Bookmarklets
A collection of bookmarklets for working with AEM

## What is a bookmarklet?
A bookmkarklet is a tiny piece of javascript that runs in the browser in the form of a bookmark. It lives in the bookmarks bar for easy access, can be organized in folders and can even call and use additional libraries.

## How to use
To use a bookmarklet, click the link below of the bookmarklet you want to add, and then click the "copy raw file" option.

In your browser, add a new bookmark ('Add page...' in Chrome after right-clicking on the bookmarks bar). Give it a title and paste the code into the URL field.
All set!
